## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Setup Your `.env.local` File

> 🛑 **THIS STEP IS REQUIRED TO RUN THE PROJECT. DO NOT SKIP IT!** 🛑

You must create a `.env.local` file in the **root directory** of the project.

- This file contains environment variables that the app needs to function.
- The content of this file will be **sent via WhatsApp**.
- **Please message me** to receive the correct `.env.local` values.

👉 **Without the `.env.local` file, the project will NOT work properly! specifically the emailing part**

---

### 4. Run the Development Server

After setting up `.env.local`, start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
or
```bash
yarn dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

Would you also want me to make it a bit more "corporate" or professional depending on the style of the organisation? (could make a "Contact" section cleaner too) 🚀  
Also, do you want me to add example `.env.local` variable names (without values) to guide them better?
